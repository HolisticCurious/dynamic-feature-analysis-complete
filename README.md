# dynamic-feature-analysis-complete
A repository for the extraction of morphological features from particles in microscopy images, analysis on how they change through time and trajectory analysis.

This repository achieves:
-tracking of particles
-extraction of trajectory features
-extraction of morphological variation/dynamic features

Software requirements: ImageJ, Icy, Python interpreter

First, read the pdf file with instructions. It will tell you which files you need to obtain from Icy Such data may be obtained through alternative processing. 

The code included allows for the analysis of a dataset of microscopy images, or any dataset where there are segmented objects (one or multiple), of approximately the same size.

It is prepared to be ran in a python notebook, but future changes may include breaking the steps into py files. The notebook was ran on Google Colaboratory, so some code snippets are adapted to that purpose.
